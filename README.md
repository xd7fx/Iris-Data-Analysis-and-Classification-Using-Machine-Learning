# 📦 Iris Classification App

This Streamlit app is designed to classify Iris flower species based on their sepal and petal dimensions. Using the Naive Bayes classification model, the app predicts whether an Iris flower belongs to the Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica species.

## Features

- **Naive Bayes Classification**: Predicts the species of an Iris flower using a Naive Bayes classifier trained on the Iris dataset.
- **Interactive Input**: Allows users to input flower measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and get real-time predictions.
- **Data Visualization**: Includes plots to visualize dataset distribution and model predictions.

## How It Works

The app is built using the Scikit-Learn library for machine learning and Streamlit for the user interface. It takes input from the user for various flower dimensions and predicts the species using a Naive Bayes classifier.

## Getting Started

To run this app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/xd7fx/iris-classification-app.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder: 
    ```
    cd iris-classification-app
    ```
3. Install the required packages: 
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the Streamlit app: 
    ```
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
