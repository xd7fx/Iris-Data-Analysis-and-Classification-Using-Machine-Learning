# 🌸📊 Iris Classification App

This Streamlit app is designed to classify Iris flower species 🌺 based on their sepal and petal dimensions. Using the **Naive Bayes** classification model 🤖, the app predicts whether an Iris flower belongs to the Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica species.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🧠 **Naive Bayes Classification**: Predicts the species of an Iris flower using a Naive Bayes classifier trained on the Iris dataset.
- 📊 **Interactive Input**: Allows users to input flower measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and get real-time predictions.
- 📈 **Data Visualization**: Includes plots to visualize dataset distribution and model predictions.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The app is built using the **Scikit-Learn** library for machine learning and **Streamlit** for the user interface. It takes input from the user for various flower dimensions and predicts the species using a Naive Bayes classifier.
